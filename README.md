Isaiah's Recipes

This respoistory is a compilation of all my favorite recipes.

Perhaps this webiste will include some blogs about all that I want to talk about before actually going through the ingredient list and instructions just because that's how every other recipe website is.

It is also very annoying :).

I will be using what I have learned to create this website:
1. Main Boiler Plate
2. Following the html tree
3. lists
4. links
5. etc.
